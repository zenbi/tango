Tango Icons
===========

This icon set contains various icons following the same style as the 
Tango Icon Library from freedesktop.org.

Unlike the original set, the icon names describe the actual image instead of 
the context/action. (e.g. "bulb" instead of "status/dialog-information")

Prerendered sizes are either a power of 2 (16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512) or 
a multiple of 24 (24, 48, 96, 144, 192) and saved as a 24 bit PNG with 
alpha transparency.

If available, an SVG or large source image may be included.

Each icon includes a TXT file with the author, original source locations, 
and copyright license information.
